# FieldTracer

Vector field tracing on common types of meshes.

This package supports 2nd and 4th order field line tracing on
* 2D/3D regular Cartesian mesh
* 2D unstructured quadrilateral mesh
* 2D unstructured triangular mesh

It can be used for
* generating streamlines and fieldlines;
* checking field connectivity between spatial cells.
